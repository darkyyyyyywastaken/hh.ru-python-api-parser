garbage code for my work and ppl, who cant make a code

enjoy lol

code searches for all company vacancies, and also uses additional values
> (vacancy_title, city, salary_from, salary_to, vacancy_link) 

## below copypasta info from code

attention pls

this code forced to searching by company id,

where in url (employer_id=1) needs to be your custom id(read hh api info or seek on your own)

or put in -url- YOUR api request

also, i forgot to put in the end error and stop code, when request gets a timeout
